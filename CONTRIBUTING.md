### 3. Fixing Bugs 🔨

If you’re the type who loves to dig into code and fix things, we welcome you with open arms. Here’s how you can contribute:

- Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
- Create a new branch for your bug fix or feature.
- Write tests to ensure your changes work.
- Make your changes.
- Ensure the code style is consistent with the rest of the project (you can use `clang-format` for code formatting).
- Submit a pull request.

### 4. Adding Tests 🧪

Tests are the backbone of any solid project. If you find a bug or add a feature, writing tests for them ensures that everything keeps running smoothly. If you're unfamiliar with our testing framework, let us know—we’re happy to help!

### 5. Updating Documentation 📖

Good documentation is a gift to the future. If you see anything that can be clarified or added to, feel free to make improvements. From updating the `README.md` to creating detailed guides for new contributors, there’s always room to improve our docs.

## How to Submit Your Contributions

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the project to your own GitHub account. This creates a personal copy where you can freely experiment.
   
2. **Create a Branch**: Don’t work directly on the `main` branch. Instead, create a new branch with a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `fix-typo-in-readme` or `feature-add-sorting-algorithm`).

3. **Make Changes**: Do your thing—whether that’s writing code, fixing bugs, or improving the docs. Write clear commit messages explaining what you’ve changed and why.

4. **Test Your Code**: Make sure everything works. If possible, write tests to cover the changes you’ve made. We want our project to be robust and reliable.

5. **Push and Pull**: Once you're happy with your changes, push your branch to your forked repository and submit a pull request. If this is your first contribution, don’t worry! Just make sure your PR is well-documented.

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your pull request, here are a few things to check:

- [ ] Is your code clean and well-documented?
- [ ] Have you written tests for any new functionality?
- [ ] Is your pull request descriptive? It should explain what you've done and why.
- [ ] Have you pulled the latest changes from the `main` branch and merged them into your branch to avoid conflicts?
